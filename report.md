Created my first repository made a few commits contributing to about me, then I created a branch called feature/student-details. I created 3 files which I added onto my repository. The first file contains my student ID and name. The second file is what i am writing about now. The third file is an HTML text with hello world. I had a special commit message, then I deployed my HTML file to GitHub page. I struggled doing this.
