Created my first repository made a few commits contributing to about me, then I created a branch called feature/student-details.
I created three files which I added onto my repository.
The first file is contains my student ID and Name.
The second file is what I am writing about now.
The third file is an html text with hello world.
I had a special commit message, then I deployed my html file to Github pages.
